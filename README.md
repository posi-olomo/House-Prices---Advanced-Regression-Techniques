# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression-Techniques
I participated in the "House Prices" Competition where I trained a machine learning algorithm to help users to easily predict the price of their house based on information regarding the size and location of the house. 

I applied PCA for outlier detection and feature engineering to help improve the model.
I used an advanced Regression model: XGBRegressor and it performed well with an error of 0.19018
